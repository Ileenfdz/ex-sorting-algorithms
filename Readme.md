## Bubble

I have to make a program that orders an array of numbers by the bubble method and
also, show it on screen.

## Direct

I have to make a program that sorts an array of numbers using the direct selection method
and also, show it on screen.

## Sequential

I have to make a program that requests the element to look for and makes it inside an array once
has found that shows if it has found it and in what position, if not, find that shows the element not found.
